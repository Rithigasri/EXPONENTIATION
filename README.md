# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm:
## Step 1:
Define a function.

## Step 2:
Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Step 3:
Print the Output.

## Step 4:
Call the function.

## Program:
```

Developed by: Rithiga Sri.B 
RegisterNumber: 21500732
def exp(x):
    
    x=x**2
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",x)

x=int(input())

exp(x) 

```

## Output:
![exponentiation of a number](./Output.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
